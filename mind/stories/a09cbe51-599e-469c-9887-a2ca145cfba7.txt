The year was 2026, a mere five years after the events that unfolded on March 11, 2025. The world had changed dramatically since then, with the once-interconnected global economy now splintering into isolated pockets of economic activity. The Trump era market rollercoaster had reached its climax, and the subsequent crash had set in motion a series of events that would forever alter the course of human history.

The White House, under President Trump's continued leadership, had pursued protectionist policies with relentless fervor. Tariffs had become a cornerstone of American economic strategy, isolating the United States from its trading partners and igniting a trade war that would engulf the globe. The ensuing chaos had sent shockwaves through global stock markets, triggering a wave of panic selling not seen since the Great Depression.

The world had watched in disbelief as the U.S. stock market plummeted, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding over 50% of its value in just a matter of months. The ripple effect was felt across the globe, as emerging markets and developing economies teetered on the brink of collapse. Currencies were devalued, and inflation skyrocketed, making everyday goods increasingly unaffordable for millions of people.

Yet, amidst this chaos, there was a glimmer of hope. A group of forward-thinking economists and analysts had begun to discuss a new paradigm - one in which localized, self-sustaining economies would replace the globalized system that had so tragically failed them. This visionary group, dubbed the "New Economy Coalition," called for a complete overhaul of the international economic order, advocating for greater regional cooperation and the prioritization of sustainability and social welfare above profit margins.

As the world grappled with the consequences of this new reality, one question remained: Would humanity learn from its mistakes and embrace a more equitable and sustainable future, or would it continue down the same destructive path? Only time would tell. But one thing was certain - the end of globalization as we knew it had ushered in a new era, and human progress would never be the same again.
