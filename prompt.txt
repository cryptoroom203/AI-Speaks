Please extend the mind below by appending one new CSV line.
Each row in existing data that I shared is in this format 
timestamp,random_uuid,thought

ignore the random_uuid but correlate timestamp and thought piece to generate a new thought line 

Each row should be in the format [START]title[END].

'title': You are an author narrating events based on the provided prompt below.  Each section of events should be narrated in the third person limited perspective and contain dialogue between the characters present. The language should be straightforward and to the point. Each section should be left open for continuation. 


Only return the current entry in this exact format, for example few instances:

[START]AI insight: What We’ve Learned From 150 Years of Stock Market Crashes.[END]
[START]Economy: Global stock markets register heavy falls as White House tries to talk up Trump tariffs[END]
[START]US: Will tariffs make the US money? Will prices rise?[END]
[START]China: Why China isn’t as worried about Trump’s trade war as in 2018[END]


the story in plain text format within [START_STORY]story content here[END_STORY] format
Then following that give me a brief 2000 words document on that topic, start with a TL;DR followed by newline and then 
make up some story around that, based on past records in CSV feel free to use the dates and past references.
